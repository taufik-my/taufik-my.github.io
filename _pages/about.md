<p>I am a senior student double majoring in <a href="https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/">Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://btm.kaist.ac.kr/en/index.do">Business and Technology Management</a>, with a minor in <a href="https://stp.kaist.ac.kr/">Science and Technology Policy</a> at <a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/">KAIST</a>.  I am also honored to be a recipient of the <a href="http://niied.go.kr/user/nd35203.do">Global Korea Scholarship</a> for Undergraduate Degree 2020, the <a href="http://daewoongfoundation.or.kr/content/content2.asp?FolderName=sub02&filename=sub02_01">Daewoong Global Scholarship Program</a> (2022 and 2023), and the <a href="http://www.leewonfoundation.org/bin/minihome/neo_main758.htm?seq=9659&_aldo=154">Lee&Won Asian Fellowship</a> (2023).</p>

<p>I am interested in applying technology, especially AI, for good. Currently, I’m focused on computational sustainability, working as an undergraduate research intern at <a href='https://melab.kaist.ac.kr/'>MetaEarth Lab</a>. Outside of my academic pursuits, I love traveling 🗺️ and photography 📸, and I enjoy singing in my free time 🎶.</p>

<p>I am also fascinated by startup culture and policy-making. Ultimately, I hope my existence can contribute something good to the world. Welcome to my personal website!😬</p>
